# linter-php
=========================

This package will lint PHP files and embedded PHP within HTML files in Atom through
[php -l](http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.options.php).

## Installation
As this package only provides a service, you will need something to run it. As
such, the Linter package will be installed for you if it isn't already installed.
This provides the interface and runs the linter for you.

* Install [php](http://php.net).
* `$ apm install linter-php`

## Settings
You can configure linter-php by editing ~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu):
```cson
'linter-php':
  # php path. run 'which php' to find the path
  'executablePath': null
```
