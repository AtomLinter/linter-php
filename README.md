This package will lint PHP files and embedded PHP within HTML files in Atom through
[php -l](http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.options.php).

## Installation
As this package only provides a service, you will need something to run it. As
such, the [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package will be installed for you if it isn't already installed.
This provides the interface and runs the linter for you.

* Install [php](http://php.net).
* `$ apm install linter-php`

## Settings
You can configure linter-php from Atom's settings menu or by editing
`~/.atom/config.cson` (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu):
```cson
'linter-php':
  # php path. run 'which php' to find the path
  'executablePath': null
```
